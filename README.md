## quickObit
quickObit (formerly obitsAI) allows users to generate custom obituaries using the Open AI API. Users sign up using Google authentication (Facebook not working) and get access to the dashboard. To create obituaries, users purchase a plan using Stripe (enter card number 4242-4242-4242-4242) which allows up to 10 attempts. Save the final obituary as a PDF.
